    "question": "What is the primary quantity directly recorded during a nanoindentation experiment?",
    "answers": {
      "a": "Residual indent diameter",
      "b": "Surface roughness",
      "c": "Load and penetration depth",
      "d": "Wear volume"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "c",
    "explanations": {
      "a": "Incorrect: Residual indent size is used in macro hardness tests, not nanoindentation.",
      "b": "Incorrect: Surface roughness affects results but is not recorded.",
      "c": "Correct: Instrumented nanoindentation continuously measures applied load (P) and penetration depth (h) during loading and unloading. All mechanical properties are extracted from the resulting load–displacement curve.",
      "d": "Incorrect: Wear volume is unrelated to the nanoindentation process."

    "question": "Which part of the load–displacement curve is mainly used to calculate the elastic modulus?",
    "answers": {
      "a": "Entire loading curve",
      "b": "Hold segment",
      "c": "Initial unloading slope",
      "d": "Final residual depth"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "c",
    "explanations": {
      "a": "Incorrect: The loading curve includes plastic deformation.",
      "b": "Incorrect: Hold segment is for creep/viscoelastic effects.",
      "c": "Correct: The initial unloading slope (stiffness, S=dP/dh) is assumed to represent elastic recovery and is used in the Oliver–Pharr method to determine the elastic modulus.",
      "d": "Incorrect: Residual depth relates to plastic deformation, not modulus."

  {
    "question": "Nanoindentation hardness is defined as:",
    "answers": {
      "a": "Load divided by indentation depth",
      "b": "Load divided by projected contact area",
      "c": "Depth divided by load",
      "d": "Stiffness divided by load"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "b",
    "explanations": {
      "a": "Incorrect: Depth does not determine hardness.",
      "b": "Correct:Hardness is the mean contact pressure under the indenter, H=P_max/A_c . It represents resistance to plastic deformation.",
      "c": "Incorrect: This ratio has no physical meaning.",
      "d": "Incorrect: Stiffness is used for modulus, not hardness."

  {
    "question": "Why is nanoindentation particularly useful for thin films and coatings?",
    "answers": {
      "a": "It requires large samples",
      "b": "It measures only elastic behavior",
      "c": "It allows very shallow, localized testing",
      "d": "It produces large visible indents"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "c",
    "explanations": {
      "a": "Incorrect: Very small samples can be tested.",
      "b": "Incorrect: It measures both elastic and plastic properties.",
      "c": "Correct: Nanoindentation applies very small loads and shallow penetration depths, making it ideal for measuring properties of thin films and coatings without substrate interference.",
      "d": "Incorrect: Indents are extremely small and usually invisible."
