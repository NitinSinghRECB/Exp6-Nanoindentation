# **Experimental Procedure**

## **1. Sample Preparation**
Prepare a flat and smooth specimen surface by grinding and polishing to a mirror finish.  
Remove dust, oxides, or contaminants to ensure reliable contact between the indenter and the material.  
A smooth surface minimizes measurement errors in depth and contact area.

---

## **2. Instrument Setup and Calibration**
Switch on the nanoindenter and allow thermal stabilization.  
Calibrate the load frame and displacement sensor.  
Determine the indenter area function using a standard reference material (e.g., fused silica)  
to account for tip rounding and geometric imperfections.

---

## **3. Indentation Parameters Selection**
Select the maximum load (or depth), loading rate, and hold time.  
Ensure that the chosen load produces indentation depths **less than ~10% of the sample thickness**  
(for coatings) to avoid substrate influence.

---

## **4. Indentation Testing**
Perform multiple indentations at different locations on the surface.  
Maintain sufficient spacing between indents (**3–5× the indentation size**)  
to prevent overlap of plastic zones.  

During each test, continuously record:
- Load **P**
- Penetration depth **h**

This generates the **load–displacement (P–h) curve**.

---

## **5. Data Extraction**
From each unloading curve, determine the **initial unloading stiffness (S)**.  

Compute:
- Contact depth: **h<sub>c</sub>**
- Projected contact area: **A<sub>c</sub>**
- Hardness: **H = P<sub>max</sub> / A<sub>c</sub>**
- Reduced modulus: **E<sub>r</sub>**

Then use the elastic relation to compute the specimen’s **elastic modulus (E)**.

---

## **6. Repeatability and Averaging**
Repeat the test for **8–10 indents**  
and calculate:
- Average hardness  
- Average modulus  
- Standard deviation  

This ensures consistency and reliability.

---

## **7. Wear Resistance Correlation**
Using the measured properties, calculate:
- **H / E**
- **H<sup>3</sup> / E<sup>2</sup>**

These ratios help determine wear and fracture resistance.
