      "question": "A material shows a high value of H/E. This primarily indicates:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "High plastic deformation",
        "b": "High elastic recovery",
        "c": "High thermal conductivity",
        "d": "High surface roughness"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: High plastic deformation corresponds to low H/E.",
        "b": "Correct: High H/E indicates greater elastic recovery and resistance to crack initiation.",
        "c": "Incorrect: H/E is unrelated to thermal properties.",
        "d": "Incorrect: H/E has no relation to surface roughness."
      },

      "question": "If the unloading stiffness S increases while all other parameters remain constant, the calculated modulus will:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Decrease",
        "b": "Increase",
        "c": "Remain unchanged",
        "d": "Become zero"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: Higher stiffness means higher modulus.",
        "b": "Correct: E<sub>r</sub> ∝ S. Higher stiffness corresponds to higher elastic modulus, meaning the material is stiffer and offers greater resistance to elastic deformation.",
        "c": "Incorrect: Stiffness directly influences modulus.",
        "d": "Incorrect: Modulus cannot become zero when there is measurable stiffness."

      "question": "Two materials have the same hardness. Material A has lower modulus than Material B. Which will likely show better wear resistance?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Material A",
        "b": "Material B",
        "c": "Both same",
        "d": "Cannot be predicted"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct: Lower modulus indicates higher  H/E and H³/E², Material A will exhibit greater elastic recovery and smaller plastic zones, leading to improved wear resistance.",
        "b": "Incorrect: Higher modulus leads to lower elastic recovery, making it more prone to wear.",
        "c": "Incorrect: Their wear resistance will differ based on modulus.",
        "d": "Incorrect: Prediction is possible from H/E and H³/E² ratios."

    {
      "question": "Which parameter is most directly related to resistance against plastic ploughing during sliding wear?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Elastic modulus E",
        "b": "Maximum load Pmax",
        "c": "Contact depth hc",
        "d": "H³/E²"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: Modulus alone does not determine ploughing resistance.",
        "b": "Incorrect: Load is only experimental input, not a material property.",
        "c": "Incorrect: Contact depth is an indentation geometry parameter.",
        "d": "Correct: H³/E² quantifies resistance to plastic deformation and plastic zone size. Higher values reduce ploughing and debris formation, directly lowering wear."
